# Guantr: A Flexible, Type-Safe Authorization Library for JavaScript

In the rapidly evolving world of web and application development, managing user permissions and access control is a fundamental yet complex challenge. To address this, we are excited to introduce **Guantr**, a versatile and type-safe JavaScript library designed to streamline and enhance your authorization needs.

Inspired by the robust features of [CASL](https://github.com/stalniy/casl) created by [Sergii Stotskyi](https://github.com/stalniy), Guantr offers a modern, efficient approach to permission management, making it easier for developers to secure their applications.

## What is Guantr?

Guantr is a JavaScript library tailored for developers who need a reliable and flexible way to handle permissions and access control within their applications. It provides a straightforward yet powerful framework for defining and checking permissions, ensuring that users can only access what they are allowed to.

## Key Features

1. **Type Safety:** Guantr leverages TypeScript to provide a type-safe environment, reducing runtime errors and enhancing code maintainability. This makes it easier to define permissions and resources with strong type-checking guarantees.

2. **Contextual Authorization:** With Guantr, permissions can be contextual. This means you can define permissions based on dynamic conditions that depend on the current state or context of your application.

3. **Flexible Permission Definitions:** Guantr allows you to define permissions in a flexible manner. You can specify permissions using callback functions, which provide a clear and concise way to set up complex authorization rules.

4. **Comprehensive Permission Checking:** The library offers detailed methods to check if a user can or cannot perform certain actions on specified resources. This helps in implementing fine-grained access control policies.

## How Guantr Works?

Guantr provides a straightforward API to manage and check permissions. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how you can utilize Guantr in your project:

### Defining Permissions

Permissions are defined using the `setPermission` method. You can specify what actions are allowed or denied on specific resources, optionally providing conditions for more granular control.

```ts
const guantr = createGuantr();

guantr.setPermission((can, cannot) => {
  can('read', 'post');
  cannot('read', ['post', { archived: true }]);
});
```

In this example, the user is allowed to read any post but cannot read posts with the `archived` flag set to `true`.

### Checking Permissions

Once permissions are set, checking them is as simple as calling the can or cannot methods:

```ts
guantr.can('read', 'post');
guantr.cannot('read', ['post', { archived: true }]);
```

### Contextual Conditions

Guantr supports context-based permissions, which are useful when permissions depend on dynamic conditions:

```ts
const contextGuantr = createGuantr().withContext({ userId: '123' });

contextGuantr.setPermission((can, cannot) => {
  can('read', 'Post');
  cannot('delete', ['Post', { owner: '$context.userId' }]);
});

const canDelete = contextGuantr.can('delete', ['Post', { owner: '123' }]); // true
```

Here, the permission to delete a post is evaluated based on the context (e.g., the current user's ID).

## Why Choose Guantr?

Guantr stands out due to its balance of simplicity and flexibility. Its design allows for seamless integration into any JavaScript or TypeScript project, whether it's a small application or a large-scale enterprise solution. By adopting Guantr, you ensure that your authorization logic is clear, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements.
